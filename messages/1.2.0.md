v1.2.0 (2015-08-28)
-------------------

- You can create `.hidden-tmTheme` files by adding a global `@hidden: true;`
  rule to the source. The rule is consumed and the output file's extension
  adjusted. (#9)
- The global `@name` rule is now optional. Sublime Text doesn't use it anyway.
- The built example schemes are now hidden, so they don't pop up in the
  "Prefereces > Color Scheme" menu anymore
